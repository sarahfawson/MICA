# Spatial Visualization Assignment - Week 6

## Instructions:
You are making a spatial graphic for a new website. Take a current topic that you might read about in the newspaper or hear about on the news. It could be anything from the Aramco sale to Brexit to the U.S. presidential campaign. Create a spatial visualization using a map base from an internet map source or one you create. Create a map-driven infographic using that base. The map has to have a typographic hierarchy and at least 25 labeled datapoints or locations. It needs to have a title, but does not need to have an introductory paragraph. The final graphic will be 1920x1080. It may be interactive, if you like.

## My Topic Choice:
I will use [leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/) to plot the current polling rates of democratic 2020 presidential candidates in each state in the US.
